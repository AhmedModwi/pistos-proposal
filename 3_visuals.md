# 3. Visual Identity & Imagery Guidelines

## Bilingual Typography
- **English**:
  - Display headings: Outfit — clean geometric typeface, consistent with the Pistos logo style.
  - Body text / UI: Inter — designed for high legibility in forms, tables, and dashboards.
- **Arabic**:
  - Display headings: Tajawal — structured Arabic typeface suited for professional contexts.
  - Body text / UI: IBM Plex Sans Arabic — clear and readable for financial and legal content.
  - *تأسيس الأعمال. بنية تحتية موثوقة.*
  - *الضرائب والامتثال المالي*

## Color System
The interface uses **light mode only**. For a B2B platform dealing with legal documents, tax codes, and financial data, high-contrast paper-like visuals are more appropriate than dark themes.
- Charcoal Black (#1A1A1A) — Primary text, headers
- Deep Crimson (#A02B2E) — Action buttons, key highlights
- Off-White (#FAFAFA) — Background
- Pure White (#FFFFFF) — Card and panel surfaces

## Components & Iconography
- **UI Style**: Clean inputs, 1px borders, 4px corner radii. The look is functional and professional, similar to platforms like Stripe or Xero.
- **Icons**: Lucide Library — stroke-based, wireframe-style icons. Chosen to feel technical and appropriate for a professional services context, rather than decorative.

## Imagery Approach
We avoid generic stock photography. Instead, imagery reinforces the operational, B2B tone of the platform.

- **A. Architecture (Monochrome):** High-contrast grayscale photos of modern architecture (e.g., Dubai skyline, corporate interiors). Removes emotional bias and aligns with the neutral palette.
- **B. Data & Dashboards:** Clean, flat representations of dashboards and data interfaces. Strictly 2D — no 3D illustrations or isometric graphics.
- **C. Workspace Context:** When people are shown, the focus is on the environment — desks, documents, servers. The emphasis is on process, not personality.

## Motion & Animation
Animations are intentionally slow and minimal. Fast, attention-seeking motion is not appropriate for a B2B professional audience.
- **Speed:** 1.5s–2.8s durations for scroll-triggered elements.
- **Easing:** Smooth curves that feel deliberate, not bouncy.
- **Restrictions:** No parallax, no scroll-jacking, no looping animations.
- **Performance:** All animation choices are aligned with Core Web Vitals targets (CLS and INP).
