# Executive Summary

## What This Proposal Covers
This document outlines a digital strategy for Pistos, a business setup advisory operating in the UAE. It covers market positioning, technical architecture, visual identity, and a phased delivery plan.

## Market Context
The UAE business setup market includes over 200 registered firms. Among the top-tier competitors, the standard has moved beyond static brochure websites. Leading firms now offer interactive cost calculators, client portals, bilingual interfaces, and AI-powered tools. Pistos needs to meet this standard while offering a cleaner, more focused experience.

## Strategic Direction
Pistos is not positioned as a price-based competitor. It serves as the entry point into a broader group of companies under Mr. Shabib's portfolio:
- **Pistos** — Business Setup (Mainland & Free Zone)
- **The One Accountant** — Tax & Audit Services
- **DuneSaura** — Real Estate & Workspaces
- **Mindcom** — IT & Microsoft Cloud Solutions

The website's primary role is to establish credibility and guide qualified leads into this ecosystem.

## Two-Layer Technical Approach

**Layer 1 — Public Website (Astro)**
A fast, lightweight public site focused on SEO performance and credibility. No login required. No dashboards. Its job is to confirm professionalism after an initial conversation or referral.

**Layer 2 — Decision Support Tools (Next.js)**
A private web application accessed via phone authentication. It provides practical tools: cost estimation, jurisdiction comparison, trade name checking, and activity selection. Staff can view client engagement data for follow-up.

## Optional: AI Assistant
A retrieval-based AI tool can be added to Layer 2 at a later stage. It would answer common questions using pre-approved content only. This requires separate API budget approval and is not part of the initial scope.

## Delivery Sequence
1. Launch the public website (Layer 1)
2. Launch the decision support tools (Layer 2)
3. Evaluate and optionally add the AI assistant

## Visual Identity
The design follows a restrained, professional direction: light mode only, bilingual typography (English and Arabic), flat UI components, and limited use of animation. The visual tone is closer to platforms like Stripe or Xero than to consumer apps.

## Outcome
A digital presence that reflects the seriousness and operational depth of the business — not a sales brochure, but a credible extension of how Pistos already operates.
